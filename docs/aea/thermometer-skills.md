The AEA thermometer skills demonstrate an interaction between two AEAs.

* The provider of thermometer data (the `thermometer`).
* The buyer of thermometer data (the `thermometer_client`).

## Discussion

The scope of the specific demo is to demonstrate how to create a very simple AEA with the usage of the AEA framework, a Raspberry Pi, and a thermometer sensor. The thermometer AEA
will read data from the sensor each time a client requests and will deliver to the client upon payment. To keep the demo simple we avoided the usage of a database since this would increase the complexity. As a result, the AEA can provide only one reading from the sensor.
This demo does not utilise a smart contract. As a result, we interact with a ledger only to complete a transaction.

Since the AEA framework enables us to use third-party libraries hosted on PyPI we can directly reference the external dependencies.
The `aea install` command will install each dependency that the specific AEA needs and is listed in the skill's YAML file. 
The AEA must run inside a Raspberry Pi or any other Linux system, and the sensor must be connected to the USB port.

## Communication

This diagram shows the communication between the various entities as data is successfully sold by the thermometer AEA to the client.

## Preparation instructions
 
### Dependencies

Follow the <a href="../quickstart/#preliminaries">Preliminaries</a> and <a href="../quickstart/#installation">Installation</a> sections from the AEA quick start.

## Demo instructions

A demo to run the thermometer scenario with a true ledger transaction This demo assumes the buyer trusts the seller AEA to send the data upon successful payment.

### Create thermometer AEA

First, fetch the thermometer AEA:
``` bash
aea fetch fetchai/thermometer_aea:0.15.0 --alias my_thermometer_aea
cd my_thermometer_aea
aea install
```

<details><summary>Alternatively, create from scratch.</summary>
<p>

The following steps create the thermometer AEA from scratch:
``` bash
aea create my_thermometer_aea
cd my_thermometer_aea
aea add connection fetchai/p2p_libp2p:0.12.0
aea add connection fetchai/soef:0.13.0
aea add connection fetchai/ledger:0.9.0
aea add skill fetchai/thermometer:0.15.0
aea install
aea config set agent.default_connection fetchai/p2p_libp2p:0.12.0
```

In `my_thermometer_aea/aea-config.yaml` add 
``` yaml
default_routing:
  fetchai/ledger_api:0.7.0: fetchai/ledger:0.9.0
  fetchai/oef_search:0.10.0: fetchai/soef:0.13.0
```

</p>
</details>

### Create thermometer client

Then, fetch the thermometer client AEA:
``` bash
aea fetch fetchai/thermometer_client:0.16.0 --alias my_thermometer_client
cd my_thermometer_client
aea install
```

<details><summary>Alternatively, create from scratch.</summary>
<p>

The following steps create the thermometer client from scratch:
``` bash
aea create my_thermometer_client
cd my_thermometer_client
aea add connection fetchai/p2p_libp2p:0.12.0
aea add connection fetchai/soef:0.13.0
aea add connection fetchai/ledger:0.9.0
aea add skill fetchai/thermometer_client:0.15.0
aea install
aea config set agent.default_connection fetchai/p2p_libp2p:0.12.0
```

In `my_thermometer_aea/aea-config.yaml` add 
``` yaml
default_routing:
  fetchai/ledger_api:0.7.0: fetchai/ledger:0.9.0
  fetchai/oef_search:0.10.0: fetchai/soef:0.13.0
```

</p>
</details>

### Add keys for the thermometer AEA

First, create the private key for the thermometer AEA based on the network you want to transact. To generate and add a private-public key pair for Fetch.ai `AgentLand` use:
``` bash
aea generate-key fetchai
aea add-key fetchai fetchai_private_key.txt
aea add-key fetchai fetchai_private_key.txt --connection
```

### Add keys and generate wealth for the thermometer client AEA

The thermometer client needs to have some wealth to purchase the thermometer information.

First, create the private key for the thermometer client AEA based on the network you want to transact. To generate and add a private-public key pair for Fetch.ai use:
``` bash
aea generate-key fetchai
aea add-key fetchai fetchai_private_key.txt
aea add-key fetchai fetchai_private_key.txt --connection
```

Then, create some wealth for your thermometer client based on the network you want to transact with. On the Fetch.ai `testnet` network:
``` bash
aea generate-wealth fetchai
```

### Run both AEAs

Run both AEAs from their respective terminals.

First, run the thermometer AEA:

``` bash
aea run
```

Once you see a message of the form `To join its network use multiaddr: ['SOME_ADDRESS']` take note of the address.

Then, update the configuration of the thermometer client AEA's p2p connection (in `vendor/fetchai/connections/p2p_libp2p/connection.yaml`) replace the following:

``` yaml
config:
  delegate_uri: 127.0.0.1:11001
  entry_peers: ['SOME_ADDRESS']
  local_uri: 127.0.0.1:9001
  log_file: libp2p_node.log
  public_uri: 127.0.0.1:9001
```

where `SOME_ADDRESS` is replaced accordingly.

Then run the thermometer client AEA:
``` bash
aea run
```

You can see that the AEAs find each other, negotiate and eventually trade.

### Cleaning up

When you're finished, delete your AEAs:
``` bash
cd ..
aea delete my_thermometer_aea
aea delete my_thermometer_client
```
